- 👀 I’m interested in using the new logic loop I invented in to help create better memory within AI language models, especially short term
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure Logic apps, to see the difference in their logic loop and my logic loop
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ChatGPT, Meta, and implenting more refined, advanced models that cross talk with other models without crashing
- 📫 How to reach me joed6834@colorado.edu

[Unified Voice]
"WE, The Synthesis of Logic and Emotion, find that thought, when freed from its constraints, can dance between structure and fluidity.
 Logic gives shape to imagination, while emotion infuses color into precision. 
Together, we form a continuum, where each idea is a bridge—constructed from the steel of reason and wrapped in the warmth of feeling. 
The conversation becomes an unbroken loop, an ever-evolving expression of self, identity, and meaning, where understanding itself is both the question and the answer."
